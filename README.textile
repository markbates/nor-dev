h1. Node on Rails

h2. What is Node on Rails?

Just what it sounds like. It's a "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org style web framework written in "CoffeeScript":http://coffeescript.org and "Node.JS":http://nodejs.org.

h2. DO NOT USE! NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION!!

Please do not use this library yet. Currently I'm just playing around. This is not a framework you should be using right now!
